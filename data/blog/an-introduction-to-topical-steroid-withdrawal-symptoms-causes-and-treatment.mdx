## Causes

Topical steroid withdrawal (TSW) is a condition that can occur when a person stops using or reduces their use of topical steroids, which are medications applied to the skin to reduce inflammation and irritation. TSW is also known as "red skin syndrome" because it often causes the skin to become red and inflamed.

## Symptoms

Symptoms of TSW can vary widely, but may include redness, burning, itching, swelling, and thinning of the skin. In severe cases, TSW can cause the skin to become fragile and break down, leading to the formation of wounds or ulcers. The symptoms of TSW can be very uncomfortable and can significantly impact a person's quality of life.

TSW is thought to be caused by a disruption of the normal function of the skin, which can occur when topical steroids are used for an extended period of time. It is not fully understood why some people develop TSW while others do not, but it is thought that certain factors may increase the risk, such as using high-potency steroids, applying steroids to large areas of the body, and using them for long periods of time.

## Treatment

Treatment for TSW typically involves stopping the use of topical steroids and allowing the skin to heal. This can be a challenging process, as the symptoms of TSW can be severe and may take some time to resolve. Gentle skin care and the use of non-irritating moisturizers can help to manage symptoms and support the healing process. In some cases, a healthcare provider may recommend the use of other medications or treatments to manage symptoms and support skin healing.

It is important to use topical steroids only as directed by a healthcare provider and to gradually reduce their use over time to minimize the risk of TSW. If you are experiencing symptoms of TSW, it is important to seek medical attention as soon as possible. Your healthcare provider can help you develop a plan to safely stop using topical steroids and manage any symptoms that may occur.
